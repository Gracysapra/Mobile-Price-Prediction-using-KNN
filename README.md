# Mobile-Price-Prediction-using-KNN
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict mobile phone price ranges based on features like battery power, RAM, and screen resolution. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix), and an interactive Gradio interface for predictions.
